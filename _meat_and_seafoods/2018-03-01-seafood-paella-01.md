### Ingredients
- 2 cups Spanish paella rice
- 1 quart chicken or vegetable broth
- 2 medium tomatoes
- 1 onion
- 1 pound shrimp
- 3 - 4 cloves garlic
- 10 - 15 threads saffron
- sea salt and pepper to taste
- 4 Tablespoons of olive oil

### Preparation

1. Rinse the rice in cool water until the water is clear, then drain the excess water. Prepare the vegetables by washing the tomatoes and broccolini, and removing the skins from the onion and garlic. Cut the onion into quarters, then dice into small chunks. Cut the tomato into quarters, then dice into small chunks. Either dice the garlic finely with a chef's knife, or use a garlic press to mince the garlic.

2. Heat the olive oil in a skillet to medium heat. Add the onions and cook until they are translucent, stirring occasionally, for about 4 minutes. Add in the tomatoes, garlic, salt, pepper, and saffron. Let the mixture simmer for another 4 minutes. Next, add the rice, and stir to combine. Turn the heat to low, and move on to the next step.

3. Add the chicken or vegetable stock to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Transfer the rice and vegetable mixture to the pan, stirring just to combine. Set a timer for 10 minutes. While you're waiting for the rice, get started with the shrimp. Remove the shells from the shrimp and devein them. After the 10 minute timer is up, add the shrimp to the rice mixture, and cook for another 8 - 10 minutes.

4. Let the pan cool off for a few minutes, then plate and serve.

5. Bon appetite!
